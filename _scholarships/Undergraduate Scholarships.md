<p>A scholarship might be one way for you to support your post-JC aspirations,
but many students choose not to explore this option because of these five
scholarship myths:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>I must stay with my scholarship agency forever!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I must work for the government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I must be a top scorer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I must enrol in specific university courses that are determined by scholarship
agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can think about scholarships after I get my 'A' Level results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
