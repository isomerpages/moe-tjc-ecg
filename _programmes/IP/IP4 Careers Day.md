<p><strong><u>Building Future-Ready Mindsets</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The programme concluded with a classroom segment that encouraged students
to broaden their career perspectives and develop essential mindsets for
future success. Participants explored how global problems and challenges
can give rise to diverse and unexpected career pathways, learning to remain
open-minded, flexible, and adaptable when opportunities arise. The session
emphasized the importance of cultivating resilience and hope in navigating
today's VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world, equipping
students with both practical knowledge and the adaptive mindset necessary
to thrive in an ever-evolving professional landscape.</p>
