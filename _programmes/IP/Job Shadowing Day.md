<p>On Job Shadowing Day, the IP3 students shadowed their Job Hosts to gain
exposure to the world of work. For a majority of the students, they shadowed
their own parents. This gave them a better understanding and appreciation
for what their parents do for a living. A few of the students shadowed
the parents of their friend or other school staff. The Job Shadowing Programme
ended off with a sharing session where each of the students shared their
valuable experiences with their peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This programme not only enabled the students to gain exposure to the different
jobs and industries that they may never have come across before, they also
gained an understanding of the essential hard and soft skills necessary
to perform those jobs. Through their own experiences, coupled with sharings
by their peers, the students are able to make more informed considerations
for what they may want to pursue in future.</p>

students, Javier Wong.</p>
