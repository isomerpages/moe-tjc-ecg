<p>Our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme aims to equip students
with the relevant knowledge and skills to make more informed decisions
about their education and career paths. For our IP2 cohort the programme
comprises three customised components to expose students to areas concerning
their future decision-making - the IP3 Subject Combinations Talk, Introduction
to the ECG Framework, as well as on Building Career Skills Beyond The Classroom.</p>

<p>The subject combination talk is a crucial component of ECG exposure. It
is designed to help our IP2 students make more informed decisions about
their academic pathways. A preliminary engagement with the IP2 cohort about
the IP3 curriculum and subject combinations goes beyond simply listing
available subjects by delving into various factors which influence subject
choice. These include the importance of balancing their interests and aptitudes
through emphasising holistic development to guide IP students towards making
choices that not only support their academic journey, but contribute to
their overall personal growth and future career prospects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the second component, the IP2 students focus on self-discovery and
understanding their personal values, identity and qualities through self-reflection
and personality assessments. This scaffolded approach enables the IP2s
to gain a clearer understanding of themselves, which then forms the foundation
for making choices aligned with their authentic selves. They are also introduced
to our <a href="https://ecg.temasekjc.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>one-stop portal</u></a> for
ease of access to ECG resources available to support them on their journey
of self-discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the final component, the IP2 attend a sharing by the <a href="https://ecg.temasekjc.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SkillsFuture.SG</a> team
to gain awareness of the key growth industries in Singapore and the fast-changing
future of work. Additionally, they learn about the importance of developing
soft skills, as well as the development of digital literacy and 21st century
competencies essential for career success in the modern, technology-driven
workplace. Through early exposure to these key developments, we aim to
promote greater student agency amongst the IP2 students in creating practical
action plans that complement their academic knowledge as they envision
their future. Overall, this will make them well-prepared for the challenges
and opportunities of the modern workplace.</p>
