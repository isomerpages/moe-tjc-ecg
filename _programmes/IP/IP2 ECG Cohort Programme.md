<p>Our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme aims to equip students
with the relevant knowledge and skills to make more informed decisions
about their education and career paths.</p>
<p><strong><u>Learning from Alumni</u></strong><u>&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>The IP2 cohort participated in an enriching panel discussion designed
to provide valuable insights into future career pathways and professional
development. The session featured alumni from Temasek Junior College who
shared their real-world experiences and perspectives on navigating the
transition from education to employment. To ground the conversation in
contemporary issues, participants watched a video from the CNA Youth Forum
2022, which served as a springboard for deeper discussions about job prospects,
workplace expectations, and essential career preparation strategies.</p>

<p><strong><u>Key Themes and Insights</u></strong><u>&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>Throughout the panel, key themes emerged around maintaining an open mindset
toward opportunities, the importance of consistently delivering one's best
effort, and embracing career development as an ongoing journey of self-discovery
rather than a fixed destination. The alumni shared candid stories about
their own professional paths, highlighting how flexibility and adaptability
played crucial roles in their career success.</p>

<p><strong><u>Professional Guidance</u></strong><u>&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>The discussion was further enriched by contributions from the school's
Education and Career Guidance counsellor, who joined as a panelist to provide
professional insights on skill development and career planning. Students
gained practical advice on cultivating the adaptability, resilience, and
core competencies needed to thrive in today's dynamic job market, equipping
them with a more informed perspective as they prepare for their own professional
futures.</p>
