<p>🌟 IP1 Cohort Learning Journey to Lifelong Learning Exploration Centre
🌟🎓
<br>
<br>Our IP1 students recently embarked on an eye-opening journey to the Lifelong
Learning Exploration Centre, which opened eyes and minds on what their
world of work would entail! Here’s a glimpse into what they took away:
<br>
<br>🌐 They explored their personality profile with the DISC psychometric
assessment, probing what triggers their peers, and conversely how best
to show appreciation to a fellow teammate. 🔍 Through immersive mixed-reality
exhibits, they identified their potential career fits and got to experience
the job hunting process, from dressing up to answering interview questions.
🙌 Job tasters in Green, Care, and Digital sectors provided hands-on experiences,
helping them understand the day-to-day realities of different professions.
Our students left inspired and prepared, with an expanded vision of their
career paths and the skills needed to thrive in tomorrow’s workplace. 🚀
