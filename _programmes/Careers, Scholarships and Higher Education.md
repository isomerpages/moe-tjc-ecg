<p>TJC has a comprehensive Education and Career Guidance (ECG) curriculum.
TJC&nbsp;provides students with career counselling and scholarship advisories
to stand them in good stead to achieve their aspirations.</p>
<p>TJC offers numerous opportunities for students to explore the infinite
possibilities of what life can hold for them when they graduate. We conduct
workshops and classes on how to write an effective statement and how to
sit for an interview. Students will also have the opportunity to hear from
various agencies about the scholarships they offer and clarify questions
they have about studying in the local autonomous universities. TJC also
invites alumni and representatives from overseas universities to share
with our students on what studying overseas is like.</p>
<h4>Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education (CSHE) Day</h4>
<p>Annually, TJC organises the Careers, Scholarships and Higher Education
(CSHE) Fair, which consists of career talks and an exhibition with participating
organisations from both public and private sectors.</p>

<p>In the CSHE Fair, students will be able to think about and explore their
future in terms of higher education and careers alongside the opportunities
of scholarships in various industries and universities. We have invited
TJC alumni and professionals from various industries to share their experiences
in the different fields of work as well as their experiences while studying
in universities.</p>
