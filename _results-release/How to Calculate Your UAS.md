<p>The maximum Rank Points (RP) or University Admission Score (UAS) for admissions to university a student can achieve is 90. A higher score (out of 90) would place a student in a better position for admissions to university. The RP/UAS is calculated based on the grades that you have obtained for the different subjects you have taken. Each grade corresponds to a different number of rank points as shown in the table below:</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/UAS_Grade_Table.PNG"></div><p></p><h4><strong>Case 1: Calculation of UAS for students who offered 3H2s + 1H1s, WITHOUT H1 MTL or O-Level HMTL</strong></h4><p>A student’s UAS is calculated by adding together the subject rank points the student has achieved for</p><ul><li><p>best four content subjects (i.e. three H2 content subjects and one H1 content subject)</p></li><li><p>H1 General Paper,</p></li><li><p>and H1 Project Work.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Maximum UAS = 3 H2 + 1 H1 + H1 GP + H1 PW</strong></p><p><strong>                              = 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10</strong></p><p><em>In <u>Case 1</u>, assuming a student achieves an ‘A’ for all subjects with the exception of a ‘B’ for one of his/her H2 subjects, the calculation of UAS is as follows:</em></p><p><em>UAS = 3 H2 + 1 H1 + H1 GP + H1 PW</em></p><p><em>= 20 + 20 + 17.5 + 10 + 10 + 10</em></p><p><em>= 87.5</em></p><hr><h4><strong>Case 2: Calculation of UAS for students who offered 3H2s + 1H1s, WITH H1 MTL or O-Level HMTL</strong></h4><p><strong><em>(Note: the higher score with or without H1 MTL / O-Level HMTL is taken to be your UAS.
