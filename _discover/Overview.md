<p>In this section, you will find many tools and frameworks to help you discover
your purpose, and consequently kickstart your career goal exploration journey.
These include career interests, skills, work values, and learning styles.</p>
<p>To begin, the career decision wheel is a useful tool, which helps you
to consider a variety of factors (reflected by spokes on the Wheel) to
make informed education and career decisions. The career wheel can be divided
into external (top half) and internal (bottom half) factors. You may explore
the internal factors, i.e. values, interests, personalities and skills,
more in the next section.</p>

one person may consider educational background to be very important; whereas,
another person might focus more intently on work experience.</p>
